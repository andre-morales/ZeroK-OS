# XtX
XtOS, XtBootMgr, and its associated homebrew programming language: CASM.

## What is XtOS?
This is a enthusiast operating system project meant for experimentation with assembly language, C, and
the technology behind the software that powers our everyday computers and servers. XtOS is not meant
to be used as a true operating system nor does it have that as its objective, it's just a simple experiment
for learning.

## What is XtBootMgr?
This is a general purpose boot manager intended for classic legacy booting.
It aims to be flexible allowing to boot all kinds of different partitions and to not
stand in the way of a user who wants to experiment with XtOS.
It also works in minimal environments allowing to be tested in even the oldest of computers.

## What is CASM?
CASM stands for C ASM and is essentially vanilla assembly language with a few fancier features
sprinkled in to help general assembly development. The original CASM transpiler is written in
standard java and its project is included in this repository. Also included are some tools to
aid in development with the language.
