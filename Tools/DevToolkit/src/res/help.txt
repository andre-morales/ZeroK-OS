[Orders types]
Here are the possible orders you can use:

burn <input>: Writes <input> file into another file, with configurable offsets
  and length. Primarily used to burn bootloaders.
  -to <path>: Destination file
  -srcOff <number>: Offset into the source file. By default is 0.
    Anything behind the source offset will be ignored.
  -dstOff <number>: Offset into the destination file. By default is 0. 
  -length <number>: How many bytes of the input should be written. If not
    specified, the whole input will be written into the destination.

partitions <disk>: Lists the given partitions in an MBR <disk> file
	
syncdisk <disk>:

mountdisk <disk>: Mounts a virtual disk. On Windows, this command invokes the
  diskpart system utility and requires elevated privileges.

  diskpart system utility and requires elevated privileges.
